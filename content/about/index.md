I am a senior at **Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati**, majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I most recently interned at **Microsoft** where I worked on **Message Extensions** on **Word Online**. 

Beyond the code, I love playing the piano and watching football. I'm always willing to learn new things and work on cool stuff, so hit me up!
